# Hackathon_Gen_Algo Repository

This repository houses the codebase and documentation for the decentralized AI project undertaken during [Hackathon Name]. The project focuses on Genetic Algorithms, Large Language Models (LLM), and word vector similarity to advance decentralized AI training and prompt engineering.

## Python Notebooks

### 1. Word_Vector_Similarity.ipynb

This notebook explores the Word Vector Similarity module, which quantifies the effectiveness of the LLM in generating relevant responses. It employs a method based on word vector similarities, enhancing the precision of AI-generated responses to prompts.

### 2. FITNESS_FUNCTION_GENETIC_ALGORITHM_CHALLENGE_04_OPENMESH(1).ipynb

This notebook contains the Fitness Function and Genetic Algorithm implementation. It plays a crucial role in evaluating and evolving our models for improved performance, contributing to the overall success of the decentralized AI system.

### 3. LLM.ipynb

The LLM notebook integrates the Large Language Model, specifically GPT-2, into our project. This transformer-based model serves as the cornerstone, excelling in natural language understanding tasks and enhancing AI responsiveness.

### 4. Gen_Algorithm.ipynb

This notebook focuses on the Genetic Algorithm, a fundamental component of our decentralized AI project. It outlines the logic and processes involved in evolving AI models to meet the evolving demands of the system.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project and explore the notebooks, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
